## ‚ö°Ô∏è Why @nextshopkit/sdk?

Headless Shopify is powerful ‚Äî but using the Storefront GraphQL API directly is painful:

- Complex queries for simple needs
- Inconsistent metafield handling
- Lots of repeated boilerplate
- No opinionated support for modern frontend workflows

`@nextshopkit/sdk` simplifies this with:

- ‚úÖ Prebuilt, type-safe SDK functions (e.g. `getProduct`, `createCart`)
- üß† Metafield parsing and normalization helpers
- üõí Cart management powered by React Context (soon)
- üîê Server-only by design ‚Äî credentials never leak
- üß© Plug-and-play with Next.js, but **not locked in** to any framework

Whether you're building a custom store with **Next.js**, **Remix**, or plain **React**, this SDK gives you the power of Shopify ‚Äî without the lock-in.
